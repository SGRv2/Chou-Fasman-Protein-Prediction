==========


The intent of this project was to implement the Chou-Fasman algorithm, an empirical  protein secondary structure prediction algorithm. The original paper is on PubMed http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4358940 while an improved version can be found at http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/S4/S14


This algorithm is an empirical method that favors speed over accuracy, intended for generalizing secondary structure at a glance.


The tool will be hosted with others after the launch of University of Rhode Island's Antimicrobial Peptide Database.  The implementation was built so that the source code could be easily read by biochemists, and so that it could be extended with more rules to improve accuracy.
