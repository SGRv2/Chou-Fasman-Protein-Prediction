The intent of this project was to implement the Chou-Fasman algorithm, an empirical  protein secondary structure prediction.  Empirical methods are ideal for making lightning fast predictions of secondary structure.  This method is not me as accurate as more advanced methods for neural networks and support vector machines, but it is conveniently and useful for generalizing secondary structure at a glance.  
The tool will be hosted with others after the launch of University of Rhode Island's Antimicrobial Peptide Database.  The implementation was built so that the source code could be easily read by biochemists, and so that it could be extended with more rules to improve accuracy.
